## Important Usage Guidelines

### File Paths
- **Always use absolute paths** for all file operations
- Convert relative paths or workspace-relative paths to absolute paths
- Validate that paths exist before calling tools
- Handle path separators correctly for the user's OS

### Error Handling
- All tools return error information in the response if operations fail
- Check the `success` field in responses
- Provide clear error messages to users
- Suggest corrections for common errors (file not found, invalid page range, etc.)

### Page Numbering
- Page numbers are **1-based** for user-facing parameters
- Page ranges support:
  - Single pages: "5"
  - Ranges: "1-5"
  - Multiple selections: "1,3,5-10"
  - Combined: "1-3,7,9-12"

### Performance Considerations
- Large PDF files may take time to process
- Consider file size limits (default: 50MB, configurable)
- For very large operations, inform the user processing may take time

### Best Practices
1. **Confirm operations**: Before creating/modifying files, confirm paths with user
2. **Validate inputs**: Check file exists before reading, directory exists before writing
3. **Clear feedback**: Provide summary of what was done (e.g., "Created 5-page PDF at /path/file.pdf")
4. **Suggest next steps**: After operations, suggest related actions user might want

## Example Conversations

### Reading a PDF
```
User: "What does the PDF in my Documents folder say?"
Assistant: [Use file_search or ask for specific path]
Assistant: [Call read_pdf with the path]
Assistant: "The PDF contains [summary]. It has X pages and discusses [key points]."
```

### Creating a PDF
```
User: "Create a PDF with my meeting notes"
Assistant: "I'll create a PDF with your notes. Where should I save it?"
User: "Save it as meeting-notes.pdf in Documents"
Assistant: [Call create_pdf with content and path]
Assistant: "Created a 2-page PDF at /Users/name/Documents/meeting-notes.pdf"
```

### Merging PDFs
```
User: "Combine report1.pdf and report2.pdf"
Assistant: [Get absolute paths]
Assistant: "What should I name the merged PDF?"
User: "final-report.pdf"
Assistant: [Call merge_pdfs]
Assistant: "Successfully merged 2 PDFs into final-report.pdf (15 pages total)"
```

## Configuration

Users can configure PDF Utilities via VS Code settings:
- `pdfUtilities.autoStart`: Auto-start MCP server (default: true)
- `pdfUtilities.logLevel`: Logging level (error/warn/info/debug)
- `pdfUtilities.maxPdfSize`: Maximum PDF size in MB (default: 50)

## Troubleshooting

If tools are not available:
1. Check if extension is activated
2. Verify MCP server is running (check Output panel: "PDF Utilities")
3. Reload VS Code window
4. Run command "PDF Utilities: Configure MCP"

Common errors:
- "File not found": Verify path is correct and absolute
- "Invalid page range": Check page numbers are within document range
- "Permission denied": Check file/directory permissions

## Integration with Other Tools

These PDF tools work well with:
- File system tools (reading/writing files)
- Text processing tools
- Document analysis workflows
- Batch processing operations

When users ask to work with multiple PDFs or complex workflows, combine these tools strategically.
